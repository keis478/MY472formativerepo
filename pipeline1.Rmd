## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
data <- cars
head(data)

data$log_speed <- log(data$speed)
data$log_dist <- log(data$dist)

data$dist_bin <- cut(data$dist, breaks = 3, labels = c("short", "medium", "long"))

summary(data)
```
